    <h2>ALPR - Automatic License Plate Readers</h2>
    <p>
      This site publishes records received through a Pennsylvania
      <strong>Right-to-Know (RTK) request</strong> filed with the
      <strong>City of Harrisburg</strong>.  That RTK request was centered around the cities recent installation of Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPR).
      Installed with the intent to fight crime this technology creates an indiscriminate and constant surveillance network in the city.  This is a liability for citizens.
      In documents returned the systems ability to tie into wider databases is highlighted.  The below image is an example from the selected vendors (PlateLogiq) proposal.

      The City was professional to work with and responded on time with
      the requested materials. All citizens should feel empowered to ask their government questions.  What's your question?

    <h2>Returned Documents</h2>
    <p>
      Below are documents provided in response to the RTK request.

      The documents that were returned had the names and contact
      information for individuals related to the project.  From sales-people to points of contact.  This is about
      privacy, so we're not trying to blast out working people's info.  The only redaction done on the returned documents are specific names.

      In addition to ALPR information this returned a continuation of The Cities contract with Cellebrite - a well known cell phone ripper software that breaks into and duplicates a phones content.
