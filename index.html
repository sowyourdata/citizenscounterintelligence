      This site publishes records received through a Pennsylvania
      <strong>Right-to-Know (RTK) request</strong> filed with the

    </p>
    <p>
      The City was professional to work with and responded on time with
      the requested materials. The documents shared here are representative
      examples of the records received.

    <h2>Example Documents</h2>
    <p>
      Below are example documents illustrating the types of records
      provided in response to the RTK request.

      privacy, so we're not trying to blast out working people's info. More documents will be released once this
